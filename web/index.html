				<h1>"Project Athena" Applications Repository</h1>
				<p>This repository stores the optional <b>tablet's applications</b> and <b>functionalities</b> provided by the contributions of the community members. 
				If you have created an Application or functionality and want to offer it to the community, this is where you can do it.</p>

				<h2>Before going further:</h2><ol>
					<li>If your application/functionality is a <b>core feature</b> that you think that <b>required being delivered out-of-the-box with "Project Athena"</b>, you must instead consider making your contribution directly in the "<b>Project Athena</b>" code line. See instead the <b><a href = 'https://github.com/kasenvr/project-athena'>Project Athena</a></b> repository and contact their maintainers.</li><br>
					<li>If your application/functionality has any <b>dependency with an external server or services</b>. <i>(If it has to deal in any ways with other servers than a Project Athena Domain or Metaverse API)</i> This repository is not where you should publish your application. It will have to be published from a different source like the <b>Marketplace</b> <i>(when it will exist)</i> or another web site.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<h2>Conditions for acceptance:</h2><ol>
				<li>You must include in your script a <b>license</b> reference making your script fully open source:<br>

				<li>Add your application/functionality in a <b>folder</b> under the "<b><a href = 'https://github.com/KebHelion/apps_repository/tree/master/applications'>applications</a></b>" directory.<br>
				<font class = 'greencommented' >(Your main js file and your icon must be directly in that folder)</font></li><br>

				<li>You must add your application/functionality to the "<b>metadata.js</b>" file (in the "<b><a href = 'https://github.com/KebHelion/apps_repository/tree/master/applications'>applications</a></b>" directory) by generating a new one using this tool: <b><a href='metadata_js_generator.html'>Metadata Generator</a></b></li>
				</ol>

				<p><b>Submit a "<u>Pull Request</u>" to add your "<u>application folder</u>" and the new "<u>metadata.js</u>" file.</b><br>
				<font class = 'greencommented' >(If you are not comfortable with those procedures, contact <b>Keb Helion</b> on "Project Athena" Discord.)</font></p>
